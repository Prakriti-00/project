This project is something my partner Saanvi M and I(Prakriti) have worked on for our Web fundamentals class at Rv University. 
We were instructed to host a webpage through Github using the appropriate Git commands. 
We were also instructed to make an SRS document and Several test cases to test the validity and working of our project. 
The webpage consists of a wedding invitation, We have used simple html and css to construct the webpage and we have used the git commands to ensure that we can host it on github.
